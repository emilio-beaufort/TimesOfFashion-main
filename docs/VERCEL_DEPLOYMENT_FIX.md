# Vercel Deployment Fix

## Issues Fixed

The deployment was failing due to Rollup trying to load platform-specific native dependencies (`@rollup/rollup-linux-x64-gnu`) that weren't available in the Vercel build environment. This was caused by the `lovable-tagger` development plugin.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `vite.config.ts`
- Modified the configuration to properly exclude `lovable-tagger` from production builds
- Added warning suppression for missing optional dependencies
- Added build optimizations for Vercel deployment

### 2. Created `.vercelignore`
- Excludes development files and dependencies that might cause issues
- Prevents unnecessary files from being uploaded to Vercel

### 3. Created `vercel.json`
- Explicit build configuration for Vercel
- Proper routing for React Router
- Node.js runtime specification

### 4. Updated `package.json`
- Added explicit production mode to build script
- Added clean script for dependency management

## Next Steps

1. **Commit and push your changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Vercel deployment issues"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Redeploy on Vercel:**
   - Go to your Vercel dashboard
   - Trigger a new deployment
   - The build should now complete successfully

3. **If issues persist:**
   - Try the clean script: `npm run clean`
   - Check Vercel logs for any remaining errors
   - Ensure all environment variables are properly set in Vercel dashboard

## What Was Fixed

- **Rollup native dependency issue**: The `lovable-tagger` plugin was causing Rollup to look for Linux-specific native dependencies during build
- **Development dependencies in production**: Ensured development-only plugins are excluded from production builds
- **Build optimization**: Added proper Vercel-specific build configurations

The deployment should now work without the Rollup module resolution errors.
